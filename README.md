# Basic Camera Setup in OpenGL

This repository provides a basic setup for an OpenGL camera, including example code for camera movement and perspective projection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **GLFW:** For window and input management. Download from [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html).
2. **GLM:** Header-only math library. Get it from [GLM GitHub](https://github.com/g-truc/glm).
3. **GLAD:** OpenGL function loader. Generate the loader code at [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/).

### Setup and Compilation

1. **Extract** GLFW and GLM to your project directory.
2. **Place** GLAD files (`glad.c` and `glad.h`) in your project.

3. **Compile** the project using the provided `tasks.json` in the `.vscode` folder. This file is set up for building with Visual Studio Code.

4. **Run** the resulting executable to see the camera in action.

### Usage

The project includes basic camera controls. Use keyboard and mouse input to move and rotate the camera.
